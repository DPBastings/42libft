# libft

## Introduction
The `libft` library contains a number of low- to mid-level functions, originally created for the eponymous [42School](https://www.github.com/42School) project. Many `libft` functions are re-implementations of `libc` functions. Since its inception, the library has been extended with additional, more complex functions (e.g. `ft_getline()`) and structures (e.g. `hashtable`).

### Building
To build the `libft.a` archive, simply invoke `make` in the repository's root directory.

## Contents
The library's contents can be classified into the following header files:
+ `ft_ctype.h`: Functions related to character class testing.
+ `ft_hash.h`: A simple hash table implementation and related functions.
+ `ft_limits.h`: Constant definitions of various properties of different variable types.
+ `ft_list.h`: Various linked list-type implementations and related functions.
+ `ft_math.h`: A supplement to the C `math` library.
+ `ft_stdio.h`: Functions pertaining to I/O operations (including a family of formatted printing functions).
+ `ft_stdlib.h`: Miscellaneous functions pertaining to memory allocation and numeric conversion.
+ `ft_string.h`: String and memory manipulation functions.
Please refer to the header files (`./include/*.h`) for a listing and description of all functions.
